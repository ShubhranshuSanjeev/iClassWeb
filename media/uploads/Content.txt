Frequently  Asked  Questions What  is  Web  Hosting? Web  hosting  allows  businesses,  organizations,  and  individuals  to  make  their  websites  or  apps  visible  on  the  internet.  Whether  they're  using  a  dedicated  server,  or  sharing  resources,  every  website  is  hosted  on  a  server.  The  only  way  for  a  website  to  be  visible  on  the  internet  is  if  it's  hosted  by  a  web  hosting  service  provider,  also  known  as  a  web  host.  In  order  to  find  a  website,  you  type  the  domain  name  (or  URL)  into  your  browser.  Your  computer  will  then  connect  to  the  server  where  the  website  is  hosted,  and  the  webpage  is  delivered  onto  your  screen. What  Are  the  Different  Types  of  Web  Hosting  Products  DreamHost  Offers? DreamHost  offers  several  different  types  of  hosting  plans  that  work  for  all  website  hosting  needs.  Shared  Hosting: Shared  hosting  is  the  most  affordable  option,  but  it  does  have  its  limitations.  Shared  hosting  customers  share  the  server's  resources  with  other  customers.  If  another  website  on  the  same  server  is  receiving  large  amounts  of  traffic,  or  using  a  lot  of  the  server's  limited  resources,  it's  possible  that  your  site  may  run  slower  as  a  result. While  DreamHost  works  hard  to  make  sure  all  sites  on  a  shared  server  never  disrupt  other  sites,  this  is  always  a  possibility  due  to  the  nature  of  the  product.  That's  why  we  recommend  that  you  look  at  our  more  powerful  options  if  you're  expecting  to  experience  high  traffic  levels  on  your  site. What  can  I  host  on  shared  hosting? Shared  hosting  is  perfect  for  blogs,  portfolios,  personal/business  sites,  and  database-driven  sites. Learn  more  about  shared  hosting WordPress  Hosting  (DreamPress) DreamPress  is  DreamHost's  managed  WordPress  hosting.  It's  a  scalable  service  that  allows  users  to  manage  their  WordPress  sites  worry-free  via  automatic  updates,  caching,  daily  backups,  and  a  content  delivery  network  (CDN). Learn  more  about  DreamPress VPS DreamHost's  Virtual  Private  Server  (VPS)  hosting  is  a  premium  solution  that  runs  faster  than  our  shared  hosting.  It's  available  as  an  add-on  to  an  existing  DreamHost  plan,  but  also  as  a  standalone  service. DreamHost's  VPSs  use  Linux-VServer  to  create  a  "virtual  machine"  that  protects  a  user's  resources  from  others  on  the  same  physical  machine.  This  allows  for  a  more  powerful  solution. Shared  vs.  VPS  Hosting On  a  shared  server,  resources  are  shared  by  other  users.  On  a  VPS,  these  resources  are  more  isolated  which  improves  performance  and  helps  to  maintain  stability.  You  also  have  the  ability  to  control  how  much  RAM  your  server  uses. What  can  I  host  on  a  VPS? A  virtual  private  server  is  ideal  for  websites  that  require  more  resources  than  a  shared  server  can  provide,  but  may  not  need  the  full  power  of  a  dedicated  server.  VPS  is  ideal  for  businesses,  ecommerce  websites,  designers,  and  developers  that  need  unhindered  performance. Learn  more  about  VPS Dedicated A  dedicated  server  is  a  server  that  only  contains  your  files  on  it.  You  also  get  full  root  access:  a  major  benefit  if  you're  looking  to  customize  your  server  to  fit  your  specific  needs.  Please  note  that  DreamHost  support  cannot  assist  if  any  errors  occur  as  a  result  of  a  customization. Another  benefit  of  a  dedicated  server  is  that  your  MySQL  server  is  on  the  same  server,  allowing  for  faster  access.  With  all  other  hosting  plans  your  MySQL  database  is  on  a  separate  database  server. What  can  I  host  on  a  Dedicated  server? Dedicated  servers  are  fully-managed,  business  class  servers.  They  are  perfect  for  resource-heavy  apps  and  giant  websites. Learn  more  about  dedicated  hosting Cloud DreamHost  offers  two  different  cloud  hosting  products. Object  Storage DreamObjects  is  a  cost-effective  cloud  storage  service,  which  you  can  use  to  host  static  data  for  your  websites,  store  backups,  or  develop  the  next  big  thing.  You  can  access  DreamObjects  in  your  panel  using  the  built-in  interface,  programmatically  via  standard  APIs,  or  with  a  growing  library  of  applications.  DreamObjects  is  compatible  with  the  Amazon  S3  API.

How  Do  I  Buy  a  Domain  Name? Buying  a  domain  name  with  DreamHost  is  simple  and  comes  with  features  that  a  lot  of  other  hosts  don't  offer.  Use  our  domain  search  tool  to  buy  your  desired  domain  name;  we'll  let  you  know  if  someone  else  has  already  purchased  it,  and  will  serve  up  alternative  versions  that  are  available.  After  buying  your  domain  name  with  DreamHost,  you'll  also  receive: +  Free  WHOIS  Privacy  Protection  (which  keeps  your  website  registration  details  private) +  auto-renewals  (so  you  don't  have  to  worry  about  a  lapse  in  ownership) +  unlimited  subdomains  (like  blog.yoursite.com,  or  mexico.yoursite.com,  for  example) +  domain  setting  controls  at  your  fingertips  (like  MX  records,  CNAME,  etc.) How  Do  I  Migrate  Over  to  DreamHost? If  you  want  to  move  your  web  hosting  to  DreamHost,  the  first  step  is  to  create  a  DreamHost  account  –  you  can  do  that  from  any  of  our  product  pages  ( Shared  Hosting ,  VPS ,  Dedicated ,  DreamPress )  During  the  signup  process,  select  the  option  to  add  your  current  domain  to  your  new  account  –  don't  worry,  this  does  NOT  affect  your  current  live  website!  Next,  you'll  need  to  backup  your  website  files  and  upload  them  to  DreamHost.  You  can  learn  more  about  this  here . Once  you've  migrated  your  website  to  DreamHost's  servers,  you'll  need  to  check  the  site  to  confirm  that  it  looks  and  functions  just  as  intended.  If  everything  looks  great,  you'll  need  to  point  your  DNS  to  DreamHost  so  people  know  where  to  find  you!  If  this  sounds  complicated,  don't  worry.  We  have  some  documentation  here on  how  it's  done. Have  some  questions  before  you  get  started?  No  worries.  Get  in  touch with  us  and  we'll  be  happy  to  help.

Frequently  Asked  Questions What  is  Web  Hosting? Web  hosting  allows  businesses,  organizations,  and  individuals  to  make  their  websites  or  apps  visible  on  the  internet.  Whether  they're  using  a  dedicated  server,  or  sharing  resources,  every  website  is  hosted  on  a  server.  The  only  way  for  a  website  to  be  visible  on  the  internet  is  if  it's  hosted  by  a  web  hosting  service  provider,  also  known  as  a  web  host.  In  order  to  find  a  website,  you  type  the  domain  name  (or  URL)  into  your  browser.  Your  computer  will  then  connect  to  the  server  where  the  website  is  hosted,  and  the  webpage  is  delivered  onto  your  screen. What  Are  the  Different  Types  of  Web  Hosting  Products  DreamHost  Offers? DreamHost  offers  several  different  types  of  hosting  plans  that  work  for  all  website  hosting  needs.  Shared  Hosting: Shared  hosting  is  the  most  affordable  option,  but  it  does  have  its  limitations.  Shared  hosting  customers  share  the  server's  resources  with  other  customers.  If  another  website  on  the  same  server  is  receiving  large  amounts  of  traffic,  or  using  a  lot  of  the  server's  limited  resources,  it's  possible  that  your  site  may  run  slower  as  a  result. While  DreamHost  works  hard  to  make  sure  all  sites  on  a  shared  server  never  disrupt  other  sites,  this  is  always  a  possibility  due  to  the  nature  of  the  product.  That's  why  we  recommend  that  you  look  at  our  more  powerful  options  if  you're  expecting  to  experience  high  traffic  levels  on  your  site. What  can  I  host  on  shared  hosting? Shared  hosting  is  perfect  for  blogs,  portfolios,  personal/business  sites,  and  database-driven  sites. Learn  more  about  shared  hosting WordPress  Hosting  (DreamPress) DreamPress  is  DreamHost's  managed  WordPress  hosting.  It's  a  scalable  service  that  allows  users  to  manage  their  WordPress  sites  worry-free  via  automatic  updates,  caching,  daily  backups,  and  a  content  delivery  network  (CDN). Learn  more  about  DreamPress VPS DreamHost's  Virtual  Private  Server  (VPS)  hosting  is  a  premium  solution  that  runs  faster  than  our  shared  hosting.  It's  available  as  an  add-on  to  an  existing  DreamHost  plan,  but  also  as  a  standalone  service. DreamHost's  VPSs  use  Linux-VServer  to  create  a  "virtual  machine"  that  protects  a  user's  resources  from  others  on  the  same  physical  machine.  This  allows  for  a  more  powerful  solution. Shared  vs.  VPS  Hosting On  a  shared  server,  resources  are  shared  by  other  users.  On  a  VPS,  these  resources  are  more  isolated  which  improves  performance  and  helps  to  maintain  stability.  You  also  have  the  ability  to  control  how  much  RAM  your  server  uses. What  can  I  host  on  a  VPS? A  virtual  private  server  is  ideal  for  websites  that  require  more  resources  than  a  shared  server  can  provide,  but  may  not  need  the  full  power  of  a  dedicated  server.  VPS  is  ideal  for  businesses,  ecommerce  websites,  designers,  and  developers  that  need  unhindered  performance. Learn  more  about  VPS Dedicated A  dedicated  server  is  a  server  that  only  contains  your  files  on  it.  You  also  get  full  root  access:  a  major  benefit  if  you're  looking  to  customize  your  server  to  fit  your  specific  needs.  Please  note  that  DreamHost  support  cannot  assist  if  any  errors  occur  as  a  result  of  a  customization. Another  benefit  of  a  dedicated  server  is  that  your  MySQL  server  is  on  the  same  server,  allowing  for  faster  access.  With  all  other  hosting  plans  your  MySQL  database  is  on  a  separate  database  server. What  can  I  host  on  a  Dedicated  server?
